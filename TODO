* Since the quotient cube algorithm requires being able to sort in dictionary order, if you pass in integers as strings certain numbers will be order incorrectly if they are not left padded. Who should take care of this?
* Fix the problem with cubing dimensions that all have the same value. Instead of making a special set of fixed dimensions we should be able to somehow write the tree out normally so that we can maintain it in place later.
